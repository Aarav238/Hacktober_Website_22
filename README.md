This can be done by forking the repository on your own remote repository, making the required changes in the project and creating pull requests to merge your changes in the original repository. All this will be showcased to you in the git session with the hands on experience where you can practically do it by operating and fixing issues of this website. 

This session is organised keeping in mind about the Hacktober Fest that is organised between 3rd Oct to 25th Oct. It is one of the biggest opportunity to contribute in open source, gain experience and earn cool swags.
